naveen: user_schema.py:
    -> check Extra cause it is depricated

mohit: that's why i've added a ConfigDict in schemas :-
        model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid", populate_by_name=True)


i have changed something in queries, in that we were importing Optional, but in newer pthon versions after 3.10 there is no need to import that instead we can use that :-
        async def get_user(req_email: str) -> Users | None:
                user_data: Users | None = await Users.find_one(Users.email_ID == req_email)
                return user_data


in Check_existing_email.py: i am adding debugging lines:-
        async def check_existing_email(req_email: str, is_signup: bool = True) -> bool:
        user_data: Users | None = await get_user(req_email=req_email)
        if user_data:
                logging.info(msg=f"User found for Email: {user_data}") #debugg
        else:
                logging.error(msg=f"User not found for Email: {user_data}") #debugg
